# Hybrid Images

Hybrid images are a type of image that combines the low-frequency components of one image with the high-frequency components of another image to create a perceptual illusion. The result is an image that appears to change depending on the viewing distance.

To create a hybrid image, two images are combined using a process called frequency domain decomposition. This process involves separating the images into their high-frequency and low-frequency components using a filter. Typically, a high-pass filter is used to extract the high-frequency components, while a low-pass filter is used to extract the low-frequency components.

The low-frequency components of one image are then combined with the high-frequency components of the other image, resulting in a hybrid image that appears to change depending on the viewing distance. When viewed up close, the high-frequency components of the image dominate, resulting in a blurred image. When viewed from a distance, the low-frequency components dominate, resulting in a clear and recognizable image.

Hybrid images are often used in visual perception research to study the mechanisms of human vision and to explore how the brain processes visual information. They are also used in artistic contexts, such as in digital art and advertising, to create visually striking images that capture the viewer's attention.

Overall, hybrid images are an interesting and unique type of image that provide insights into the complex processes of human visual perception.
