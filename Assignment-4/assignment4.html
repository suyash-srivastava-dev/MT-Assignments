    <div class="question">
      <p>
        Problem Statement: 
        <br>
        <br>Extraction of Syntactic Translation Models for  English -Indic language pair 
        <br>Demonstrate your  framework  for  different categories of sentences. Take at least 100  sentences for each category. Make sure you collect sentences of different lengths ( less than 10 words; 11-20 words; 20-40 words; 40+ words)
        <br> Type                                       Example
        <br>Declarative Sentences   ( The Sun rises in the East  )
        <br>Interrogative Sentences  (What are the major differences between metals and non-metals?)
        <br>Exclamatory Sentences  (That was a great match!)
        <br>Imperative Sentences     (Please pick up the notes when you come.)
        <br>Compound Sentences      (Rahul did not complete his homework, so the teacher punished him.)
        <br>Complex Sentences          (The children were asked to go home because it was too late.)
        <br>Long-distance dependencies       (The man next to the large oak tree near the grocery store on the corner is tall.
        <br>                                                         The men next to the large oak tree near the grocery store on the corner are tall.
        <br>                                                        The bird next to the large oak tree near the grocery store on the corner flies rapidly.
        <br>                                                         The man next to the large oak tree near the grocery store on the corner talks rapidly.)
        <br>News Headlines            ( Incessant heavy rainfall causes waterlogging in parts of Delhi)
        <br>Active sentences  
        <br>
        <br>She bought a new car. Passive voice: A new car was bought by her.
        <br>Passive sentences: 
        <br>                 Reversible      ( The baby was kissed on the head by the lady)
        <br>                Nonreversible   ( The milk was spilled by the boy)
        <br>                 Ambiguous       (The fish was eaten)
        <br> OR Sentences                      (Sometimes he would take care of the whole flock while the shepherd was resting  eating his dinner.)
        <br>                                                 ( The goat that the pig had bumped near the bush was smiling)
        <br>SVO Structured     (The boy smiling is consoling the little girl crying)
        <br>idioms                     (the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak)  (सोने पर सुहागा)
        <br>You may collect sentences from : https://sentence.yourdictionary.com/
        <br>Learn a Language With Sentence Mining
        <br>
        <br>In addition, include Some ill formed translations and try to explain the reasons.   
        <br>                                           (The train that the knife had helped under the square was cold)
        <br>
        <br>Explain your methodology
        <br>Examine your approach based on any  or combination of the following approaches:
        <br>Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation
        <br>Inversion transduction grammar (ITG) 
        <br>Bracketing Transduction Grammar (BTG)
        <br>Panini grammar 
        <br>
        <br>To be reported: 
        <br>Total number of Sentences
        <br>Number of words
        <br>Number of unique words
        <br>Evaluation metrics for sentence level : BLEU, METEOR, spearman, ..
        <br>Check the type of sentence in source and translated language. Is the form same/different, one-to- many forms
        <br>Perplexity  vs different dataset sizes
        <br>Perplexity vs different length of sentences
        <br>Perplexity vs type of sentences
        <br>Perplexity vs iterations
        <br>Also summarize issues and challenges faced and the ways to mitigate them.
        <br>List possible application area of your work.
