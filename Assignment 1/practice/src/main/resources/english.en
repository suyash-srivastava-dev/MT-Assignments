Education means to study the subjects for deeper knowledge and to understand the various subjects which are going to use in our daily life.
The term education is not limited to our bookish knowledge but it stands for knowledge that is obtaining and experiencing by us outside the books or classrooms.
Education changes our perspectives to see life.
Education in our life starts from our childhood which is began at home and education is a lifelong process which is going to end with our death or maybe if there is any after-death life, it will also remain continuous there.
In this topic, we will talk about the importance of education in our life, why is education so important, why is education important to society, the role of education in our life, what is the importance of education in our life and the importance of school education.
The topic will boost your mind with positive thoughts by knowing the importance of education in life.
So, let’s start with the topic.
What is Education.
It is an important tool that enables a person to know his rights and duties towards his family, society as well as his country.
It develops the vision of a person to see the world and also the capacity to fight against the wrong things, like, injustice, corruption, violence, etc.
It is not a secret that it is the main weapon to improve our present and future life.
It also improves the confidence of a person in his life and confidence is an important key to success.
The government of every country is investing its money for the education or the citizen of the country.
There are many countries which are providing education in its country at free of cost.
The reason behind this is to develop its nation and the nation will grow when the people of a country are more educated.
A person who is educated becomes a good citizen of his country.
Why education is so important in our life.
Education gives us the ability to change our coming future.
We can change the world in something better way where every person can enjoy his life without any tension.
And for this, we must have the ability to read and write which is going to be with us by our schooling.
Because most of the information can be grabbing by reading the books scriptures, Vedas, etc.
consequently, the person will become literate with the help of education and the ability to read and write.
When a Police officer can arrest a person.
The importance of school education.
A child of today is going to become an adult citizen of the country tomorrow.
And the education which is going to feed in his mind will reflect in the future.
So it should keep in mind that school education must focus on some important aspects which contribute to their roles in the journey of a person through his childhood to death.
We discuss many subjects in our school life such as history, mathematics, geography, politics, etc.
It sharpens the mind of children.
Because the child is taking the knowledge of every subject which boosts the mental level of the child.
The child should be encouraged for physical aspects which helps a person to tackle emergencies.
Sports are good for the physical development of a person because, in any type of sport, the person goes from stages of fun and aggression where he learns how to control a situation.
A newborn child only knows about his family and some of his neighbors.
But when he moves to his school education, he meets with the other children and interacts with people outside the home which makes him a socialistic person by making new friends.
Now, we can say that school education is very much important for a child.
It provides stability in our daily life.
You must be heard that everything can be divided but your education can’t.
With the help of your degree and knowledge, you can increase the chances to make your career better than others.
Education helps us with our financial security.
In this era, the person with higher qualifications gets higher paid jobs which helps him to secure his future.
Education makes us self-dependence in our life.
The education done by a person belongs to him only and with the help of this the person can feel secure and self-dependence.
No person in this universe does not have any dreams which he wants to be fulfilled.
Education is one of the important elements to fulfill your dreams.
So, if you want to make your dreams come true, education is a must in your life.
Every person has the right to equality.
If every person got the opportunity to take higher education, there are more chances that every person will earn much amount of money, and then there would be fewer gaps between the classes of persons.
It helps in the matter of equality.
One of the best parts of being a successful person is our confidence.
Education builds confidence in the person.
You can discuss more a topic which is already known to you.
You can talk about that topic much better than others with your knowledge which you have gained by your education.
A person who is educated can develop his moral and ethical values in a society.
It helps us to spread the knowledge in society through any mode.
It is known to everyone that a person with great knowledge is appreciated by all the persons in the society.
It makes the bonding and relation of the person with the society.
The person with a lack of education creates problems like domestic violence, poor standards of living, etc.
In other ways, education allows both male and female and other educated people to create a better society.
Because if there is no better education, there will be no better society than we want.
It is a kind of power that works in the life of a person as magic to build it very much better as he has without education.
I want to conclude my article with the words that every person should be educated so he can help the nation to make our nation proud.
Thousands of crimes can be stopped with an increase in the rate of literacy.
Every nation should encourage their people for education.
The barrel of the gun was cold against my tongue.
The gun oil had a lightly acidic taste.
I had reached the end of this path.
My past kept pounding me, like giant waves beating against the great rocks of the shore, eventually turning them into sand.
I could hear my teeth clatter on the gun as the tears streamed down my face.
I thought back to my earliest memories.
I remembered summers over at my grandparents’ house.
Being awoken in the night by the bedroom door opening, and my grandfather pulling the covers back.
I remembered having to work the fields with him, and how he destroyed my love for the outdoors.
I remembered the feelings of dread and of shame.
I remembered the confusion, not knowing how to tell anyone what was happening.
It took me several minutes to realize that the gun had misfired.
That gun had never misfired up until that point.
I had put thousands of rounds through, and never a misfire.
I do not have the arrogance to say I know why I was spared that night, but what I do know is that with a twitch of a finger, my life changed forever; it could have also ended.
Then I would not have had all the wonderful experiences I have had since then.
I know how deep the darkness goes, and when it gets that dark the only path you can see is suicide; but I promise you if you just stop, take a breath and let your eyes acclimate to the darkness you will see all the wondrous possibilities that stand before you.
The air was so thick with anticipation that I was having trouble breathing.
He sat there wringing his hands as he struggled to speak the words that had haunted him for forty years.
My father had never struggled to hold a conversation, and proudly declared on several occasions that he had “never met a stranger,” but on this gloomy Sunday afternoon he grimaced as though he were in pain trying to seek out the words to describe the nightmare that he had lived for three years.
Although my father had never been a large man, he had always been stout and strong.
I had always worried for days when I had to introduce a boy that I was dating for fear that my father would intimidate him, as he often did.
Now, however, I almost didn’t recognize the small, frightened figure that I stared at in apprehension.
His emotional frailty at this moment broke my heart.
Finally, after waiting what seemed an eternity, he finally looked at me, a skinny girl of only twenty years old holding a newborn baby, and smiled weakly.
I opened my mouth to tell him that everything was okay, and that he didn’t need to tell me these things that weighed so heavily on him if he wasn’t ready, but he just smiled weakly and held up his hand to quiet my objections.
I did as he asked and put my dreaming baby boy in his crib to sleep, then I sat on the couch near my father’s chair so that I could be close to him as he spoke.
I was there, Chicago, where he lived now, and I just had to come.
I retrieved my bag from the cargo area and started looking for the subway.
This, I was excited about.
I had never been on a subway train and couldn't wait.
I asked a police officer where to go, and he told me exactly what train to catch and what stop to get off at for the street I needed to get to my rental car.
Two hours after arriving in this city I was finally at my hotel.
After sitting on a bus all night, I wanted nothing more than to take a shower, put on clean clothes, get a bite to eat, and then, I would make the call.
We talked about my trip and how his job was going.
He asked about our friends in Tennessee and about the latest gossip around our building.
It came like I knew it would.
I asked him if he was going to be able to make it over that night.
Surprisingly, he said yes.
He arrived around six o'clock that evening smelling as good as ever, like a man, woodsy smelling cologne but a hint of sweat from working hard that day.
He asked if I had eaten dinner, and I told him no, so we went next door to Bob Evans and had dinner.
After dinner I knew it was going to happen.
We would end it or drag this on longer, but I could tell by his half smile and faraway looks during our dinner what was about to happen.
He explained he met up with an old flame from when he lived there before and things were going well.
While it felt like a hard slap across the face, like when I back talked my parents as a child, at least I wasn't surprised.
We stood there another hour talking about the weather up there and in Tennessee and every other subject you can think of.
It was ten o'clock.
I had had a long bus ride, and now that I knew we were done, I planned to spend the rest of my time in Chicago as a tourist, so we kissed one last time, hugged longer than necessary, and said our good byes.
To close the door on that chapter so I could start the next with the man who waited on me.
The man I proudly now call my husband.
Because most school personnel are not typically trained to be culturally sensitive to the complex needs of African American students, often African American students are misunderstood, unfairly treated, and given harsher discipline than other students.
Talking to my children about how to deal with racism from school administrators and some of their white peers in public schools is a prevalent conversation, among others, that I discuss with my children.
There are times when my children have come home from school very distraught because of disciplinary measures taken with them by school personnel that seemed to be more reflective of their race than their character.
Seventy-one percent of all suspended minority students are suspended for nonviolent offenses and things such as breaking school polices.
Everywhere people turn -- websites, magazines, and infomercials -- advice for improving health bombards them.
Much of this advice is commercially motivated by those eager to sell questionable supplements and diet gimmicks.
However, some of it, especially that advocating a regular exercise program, merits serious attention.
Such a program, if it consists of at least thirty minutes three times a week and if a person's physician approves it, provides numerous benefits.
Regular exercise releases tension, improves muscle tone, and increases stamina.
One of exercise’s most immediate benefits is the release of tension.
Tension builds in the body because of an over-accumulation of adrenaline produced by stress, anxiety, or fear.
Doctors agree that exercising for thirty minutes releases tension.
After tension is released, petty irritations and frustrations should be less troubling.
Planned physical exercise, therefore, can reduce, or at least control, stress.
Improved muscle tone is a second benefit of regular exercise.
Although not as immediately apparent as a better disposition, improvement does come.
About a month after starting a regular exercise program, increased strength can be observed not only in one’s muscles but also in one’s posture.
Continued exercise will continue to increase strength.
In fact, the increase in muscle tone from regular exercise is a cumulative benefit.
In addition to lowered stress and increased physical strength, exercise produces stamina.
A stronger, less stressed body is more capable of withstanding normal fatigue than a tense, weak one.
A worker who exercises regularly should be able to complete a forty-hour week and still retain enough energy for non-work activities.
Similarly, a student who exercises regularly is in better shape, literally and figuratively, for pushing through during the busiest time of the semester.
Improved endurance is one of the most important benefits of a regular exercise program.
Easy solutions to the goals of fitness saturate the media.
However, acquiring the benefits of fitness is not easy.
Nonetheless, the rewards are fully worth the effort of an established exercise program.
Regular physical activity can make a person feel more relaxed, stronger, and have greater stamina for unusual as well as routine activities.
Regular exercise helps.
“Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently,” wrote Henry Ford.
People are constantly shaped and influenced by their experiences.
People learn by doing.
Often, people learn considerably more from their mistakes than their success.
For proof of failure driving success, consider examples from both science and art, including Thomas Edison, Vincent Van Gogh, and Stephen King.
The famed inventor, Thomas Edison, rose to prominence in the late 19th century because of his successes, but even he felt that these successes were the result of many failures.
He did not succeed in his work on one of his most famous inventions, the lightbulb, on his first try nor even on his hundred and first try.
In fact, it took him more than 1,000 attempts to make the first incandescent bulb but, along the way, he learned quite a lot.
As he said, “I did not fail a thousand times but instead succeeded in finding a thousand ways it would not work.
” Thus, Edison demonstrated both in thought and action how instructive mistakes can be.
The road to contemporary success for the 19th century artist Vincent van Gogh was even more dramatically paved with failure.
In current day, van Gogh is considered one of the most celebrated painters of all time.
However, during his lifetime, he was considered a disappointment.
In current day, his paintings can sell for millions of dollars, but he struggled to sell his paintings when he was alive.
He even took to burning several of his paintings because they would not sell.
The 20th century writer Stephen King, author of novels that were turned into popular movies.
Stand by Me and The Shawshank Redemption) also experienced failure.
When he wrote his first novel, Carrie, he was teaching school in rural Maine.
Although he had previously had limited success in selling his short stories, it took him 30 attempts to get Carrie published.
He almost threw away the manuscript, but his wife pulled it out from the trash and encouraged him to try again.
It is hard to imagine Stephen King ever felt that defeated, isn’t it? Thomas Edison, Vincent van Gogh, and Stephen King demonstrate, in both science and art, that failure more often than not precedes success.
Whenever we learn a new skill - be it riding a bike, driving a car, or cooking a cake - we learn from our mistakes.
Few, if any of us, are ready to go from training wheels to a marathon in a single day but these early experiences (these so-called mistakes) can help us improve our performance over time.
You cannot make a cake without breaking a few eggs and, likewise, we learn by doing and doing inevitably means making mistakes.
If we treat failure not as a misstep but as a learning experience the possibilities for self-improvement are limitless.
Over the past few decades, academic subjects have become increasingly important in this fast-changing information-based society.
Nowadays, there has been a growing debate as to whether it would be more effective to replace physical education classes with academic subjects.
Despite the importance of sports, I highly believe that it is inevitable and more efficient to focus more on academic subjects for several reasons.
Those who argue that sports and exercise classes are needed in school base their case on the following arguments.
First of all, sports are a good way to build character and develop personality.
That is, there are necessary for learning about competition, cooperation, and good sportsmanship.
In addition, as a majority of children these days are addicted to the Internet, they find it hard to leave their computer.
Consequently, a growing number of children are becoming overweight or obese due to a lack of exercise.
So, if schools foster an environment that deprives students of getting a proper physical education, it will have a long-term negative effect on children both mentally and physically.
Nevertheless, people should not ignore the fact that devoting more time and energy to academic subjects will benefit students more in the long run.
The time devoted to physical education now would be better spent teaching students English.
This is because speaking fluent English will give young people an advantage over other college applicants and job seekers in the near future.
Besides, science will undoubtedly benefit youth more than physical education as well.
The principles learned in science will provide the necessary foundation for solving and difficult problems that are sure to arise in students' futures.
In summary, there are high hopes that educators and parents exercise wisdom in teaching young generations.
High school students face many decisions as they prepare to graduate, including what they are going to do after graduation.
Some high school students go directly to college or university after graduation.
Others prefer to travel or work for some time before going to university.
For those who choose to go college or university after graduation, there are advantages and disadvantages.
One of the big advantages of going directly from high school to college is that you are still in the habit of studying.
By going to college after graduation, you do not lose the study skills that you developed during high school.
The big disadvantages, however, is that you may not be ready for college.
You may not know exactly what you want to study, or you may be more interested in freedom and parties than in your courses.
At that age, it is often difficult for students to take on the responsibilities of college.
There are also advantages and disadvantages to working or traveling befor starting college.
Working or traveling allows you a better idea of what you want to do with your life.
You gain practical experience that helps you define what you want to study.
You also are well prepared for the responsibilities of college or university studies.
On the other hand, by the time you start college, you will probably have obligations, like a job or spouse, which keep you from focusing on studies.
In addition, travelling or working before college may cause you to spend enough time out of school that you forget how to study.
The desicion of what to do after hich school graduation can be a difficult one.
Deciding whether to go straight into college or university or take time to work or travel is something that faces every high school student.
After thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of both options, the decision should be based on what is best for you.
